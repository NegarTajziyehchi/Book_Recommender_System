# Data
The dataset for this project can be found in this [github](https://github.com/caserec/Datasets-for-Recommender-Systems/tree/master/Processed%20Datasets/BookCrossing).

Book Crossing dataset were collected by Cai-Nicolas Ziegler in a 4-week crawl (August / September 2004) from the Book-Crossing community with kind permission from Ron Hornbaker, CTO of Humankind Systems.

This data has been organized and cleaned up by Arthur Fortes [1] based on MovieLens 100k treatment [2], which removed all users and items who had less than 20 and 10 interactions, receptively, items that have no information and separated in files the explicit and implicit interactions.
